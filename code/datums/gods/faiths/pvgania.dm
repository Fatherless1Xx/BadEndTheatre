	desc = "Heathens. That's what the Friends call you. They say that you are impure, that you are weak and something to be revilled.\n\
	It was that hatred that made an Unholy Trinity out of the myriad divinities of the Land, which forced the once \n\
	disaparate powers to unite under the banner of the Erring Stone Pact. Make no mistake, this is not a jolly confederation of happy\n\
	worshippers. It it is a desperate and hastily written Mistake that will erode the foundations of all your faiths.\n\
	But perhaps it is the only thing that can stand a chance to the Friendly hordes."
