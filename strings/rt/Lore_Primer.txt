<p>The Myriad Races of the Land lost their grip upon humanity.
At long last humanity has had its revenge upon those that put the Eternal Yoke upon them.
The leader of this Fellowship, the MAN, rules from his marble palace in Thonodarci leads his followers to exact further and further acts of violence upon those
who subjugated them for so long.
<br>
The Myriad pagans of the land unite to defend their creed from the rapidly mobilizing wrath of man.
A new and violent teaching spreads amongst the downtrodden, who now say they've seen the City of Nhokt in their dreams.
